This command connects as the music_owner and saves the entire schema to a file named music_db.dmp.

expdp music_owner/YourAppPassword@localhost:1521/FREEPDB1 DUMPFILE=music_db.dmp LOGFILE=music_export.log SCHEMAS=music_owner DIRECTORY=DATA_PUMP_DIR



Recovery (Import)

This command restores the schema from the backup file. The REMAP_SCHEMA option allows you to restore it to a different user, which is a common recovery scenario.

# Note: The target user 'music_owner_restored' must be created first.
impdp system/DbForMusic_2025@localhost:1521/FREEPDB1 REMAP_SCHEMA=music_owner:music_owner_restored DUMPFILE=music_db.dmp LOGFILE=music_import.log DIRECTORY=DATA_PUMP_DIR
